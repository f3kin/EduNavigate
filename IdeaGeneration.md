# Microsoft AI Hackathon - Idea Generation
## Ideas
### ~~Duolingo for Coding~~
- Self-explanatory - teaches you a new concept and tests your knowledge with a simple problem
- Pick courses based on your pathway
- Issues:
    - Could work, but far from the ideal way to learn programming
### Daily Fact Dashboard - Polymath
- Use data to give facts and helpful learning information every day
- Suggests new things but tweaks it to preference to get a user's learning profile
- suggests games like wordle etc. that are educational
- Could be a good idea in the future, but will take the first idea
### Career Pathways - EduNavigate
- Career pathway-type app that visually guides you through to where you want to go - education pathways finder
    - Inspired by poor career planners and the lack of visibility in pathways 
- Integrate AI databases with data on courses e.g.:
    - cost 
    - duration
    - flexibility
    - location
    - contents 
    - practicality 
    - employability
    - ranking
- Weight Criteria using filters, and then apply A* to solve for the optimal path
- Consider the final two years of highschool diploma, which factors in:
    - International students
    - mature age students
